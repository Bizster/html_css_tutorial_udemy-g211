<p>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain, to the mountains.</p>


<p>The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards. Fruit trees galore. Beyond the plain, the mountains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the mountains at night and people were seeing flashes of artillery.</p>


A farewell to arms
